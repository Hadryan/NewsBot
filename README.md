# NewsBot

**This project is used to periodically read out news pages and to post them automatically to telegram channels. The Telegram Bot is supposed to stand out from others by a nice content presentation of the posts.**

## Channels
The following channels are periodically filled with new content by a cron job:

* [BrohltalInfo24](https://t.me/brohltal)
* [BILD](https://t.me/bild_de)
* [Golem.de](https://t.me/golem_de)
* [Tarnkappe.info](https://t.me/tarnkappe)
* [Heise.de](https://t.me/heise_de)




### **This project is dead.**

**With "Instant View", Telegram has created a better possibility to display links from news pages. Therefore, the developer does not want to continue this project until further notice.**
